1
00:00:00,97 --> 00:00:06,7
ladies done the president of the united
states the

2
00:00:06,7 --> 00:00:12,58
hard

3
00:00:12,58 --> 00:00:19,58
haha

4
00:00:19,59 --> 00:00:22,77
her heart

5
00:00:22,77 --> 00:00:25,95
but

6
00:00:25,95 --> 00:00:28,04
thank you so much for my plans are the
same

7
00:00:28,04 --> 00:00:33,44
have the same are before I get started
can we get the new

8
00:00:33,44 --> 00:00:40,44
presidential set up at her up

9
00:00:49,83 --> 00:00:53,28
it's worked before

10
00:00:53,28 --> 00:01:00,28
that's more like it it is great to be
back what a year

11
00:01:00,53 --> 00:01:03,6
I usually start these dinners with a few

12
00:01:03,6 --> 00:01:07,32
self-deprecating jokes after my stellar

13
00:01:07,32 --> 00:01:14,32
2013 what could I possibly talk about

14
00:01:15,74 --> 00:01:18,46
I'm it last year was rough

15
00:01:18,46 --> 00:01:23,81
sheesh at one point

16
00:01:23,81 --> 00:01:27,21
things got so bad the 47 percent

17
00:01:27,21 --> 00:01:34,21
called Mitt Romney to apologize

18
00:01:37,3 --> 00:01:38,2
of course

19
00:01:38,2 --> 00:01:41,2
we're all that healthcare dug up

20
00:01:41,2 --> 00:01:48,2
on that could have gone better

21
00:01:49,33 --> 00:01:51,909
into that made my slogan was yes we can

22
00:01:51,909 --> 00:01:55,45
in 2013 my slogan was control

23
00:01:55,45 --> 00:02:02,45
alt delete

24
00:02:03,81 --> 00:02:04,74
on the plus side

25
00:02:04,74 --> 00:02:07,88
they did turn the launch of healthcare
dug up

26
00:02:07,88 --> 00:02:14,88
in the one of the year's biggest movies
I

27
00:02:19,05 --> 00:02:21,87
but rather than dwell on the past

28
00:02:21,87 --> 00:02:26,31
I would like to pivot to this matter but
welcome our headliner

29
00:02:26,31 --> 00:02:29,78
the cement Joel McHale in

30
00:02:29,78 --> 00:02:36,78
on community job plays a preening
themselves

31
00:02:37,94 --> 00:02:44,02
obsessed narcissist so this dinner must
be real change your plans for the

32
00:02:44,02 --> 00:02:47,54
I wanna thank

33
00:02:47,54 --> 00:02:51,25
the White House Correspondents
Association for hosting us here tonight

34
00:02:51,25 --> 00:02:55,84
I am happy to be here even though I am a
little jet-lagged from my trip to

35
00:02:55,84 --> 00:02:56,39
Malaysia

36
00:02:56,39 --> 00:02:59,6
the links we have to go to to get

37
00:02:59,6 --> 00:03:03,6
CNN coverage these days I

38
00:03:03,6 --> 00:03:10,6
in

39
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:20,379
I think they're still searching for
their table

40
00:03:23,18 --> 00:03:30,18
MSNBC is here girl overwhelmed

41
00:03:30,21 --> 00:03:37,21
they've never seen an audience this big
before I

42
00:03:42,01 --> 00:03:45,01
her but look at everybody is trying to
keep up with this

43
00:03:45,01 --> 00:03:49,82
incredibly fast changing media landscape
for example a law degree

44
00:03:49,82 --> 00:03:53,17
on cable news for promoting Obamacare

45
00:03:53,17 --> 00:03:58,55
to young people going on between two
firms but that's what young people like

46
00:03:58,55 --> 00:03:59,17
to watch

47
00:03:59,17 --> 00:04:02,31
and to be fair I'm not the first person
on television

48
00:04:02,31 --> 00:04:09,31
between to potted plants I

49
00:04:20,99 --> 00:04:24,02
sometimes I do feel disrespected by
reporters

50
00:04:24,02 --> 00:04:27,45
but that's okay Seattle Seahawk

51
00:04:27,45 --> 00:04:30,81
cornerback Richard Sherman is here
tonight and he gave me

52
00:04:30,81 --> 00:04:35,63
communism great tips on how to handle it
Jake Tapper

53
00:04:35,63 --> 00:04:39,96
don't you ever talk about me like that

54
00:04:39,96 --> 00:04:43,27
on the bus problem today

55
00:04:43,27 --> 00:04:45,96
by then Richard reckon

56
00:04:45,96 --> 00:04:52,96
lamar prelim exe

57
00:04:53,72 --> 00:04:55,93
while we're talking sports just last
month

58
00:04:55,93 --> 00:05:00,41
a wonderful story American one the
Boston Marathon for the first time in 30

59
00:05:00,41 --> 00:05:07,41
years

60
00:05:07,71 --> 00:05:12,75
which was inspired and only fair since a
canyon has been present for the last six

61
00:05:12,75 --> 00:05:19,249
I

62
00:05:19,249 --> 00:05:23,02
even things up

63
00:05:23,02 --> 00:05:26,81
her

64
00:05:26,81 --> 00:05:29,38
we have some other athletes here tonight
including

65
00:05:29,38 --> 00:05:32,8
Olympic snowboarding gold medalist Jamie
Anderson is here

66
00:05:32,8 --> 00:05:39,61
proud of her incredibly talented young
lady Michelle know what cylinders we

67
00:05:39,61 --> 00:05:41,76
cannot believe what these folks built

68
00:05:41,76 --> 00:05:45,2
death-defying feats haven't seen so many
Paulo

69
00:05:45,2 --> 00:05:48,28
180 that person's Rand Paul

70
00:05:48,28 --> 00:05:54,08
this in mind that nevada rancher from is
better

71
00:05:54,08 --> 00:06:01,08
occur

72
00:06:05,3 --> 00:06:06,28
a general rule

73
00:06:06,28 --> 00:06:09,78
things dome the n well

74
00:06:09,78 --> 00:06:13,91
if the seven starts let me tell you
something I know about the negro

75
00:06:13,91 --> 00:06:17,9
I

76
00:06:17,9 --> 00:06:24,9
you don't need to hear the rest up

77
00:06:28,37 --> 00:06:31,069
doesn't support

78
00:06:31,069 --> 00:06:37,33
don't start your sons that work

79
00:06:37,33 --> 00:06:42,419
her

80
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:46,02
I

81
00:06:46,02 --> 00:06:49,58
spending around Paul

82
00:06:49,58 --> 00:06:52,61
Colorado legalized marijuana this year

83
00:06:52,61 --> 00:06:55,659
well an interesting social experiment a

84
00:06:55,659 --> 00:07:00,169
I do hope it does lead to a whole lot
paranoid people who think that the

85
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:01,11
federal government's

86
00:07:01,11 --> 00:07:06,45
out to get them listening to their phone
calls

87
00:07:06,45 --> 00:07:11,49
that would be a problem

88
00:07:11,49 --> 00:07:13,46
and speaking up conservative euros

89
00:07:13,46 --> 00:07:16,49
the Koch brothers market table here
tonight

90
00:07:16,49 --> 00:07:20,57
but as usual the use the shadowy
right-wing organization

91
00:07:20,57 --> 00:07:27,57
as a spot hello partners I

92
00:07:28,61 --> 00:07:35,61
under under skating but space box you
miss me when I'm gone

93
00:07:37,27 --> 00:07:39,82
will be harder to convince the American
People that

94
00:07:39,82 --> 00:07:43,49
hillary was born in Kenya I

95
00:07:43,49 --> 00:07:50,49
Co

96
00:07:54,61 --> 00:07:56,36
a lot of us really are concerned about

97
00:07:56,36 --> 00:07:59,46
the way big-money is influencing our
politics

98
00:07:59,46 --> 00:08:04,639
I remember when a super PAC was just me
by Marlboro 100's instead irregulars

99
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:10,479
course now

100
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:14,69
that its 2014 Washington is obsessed

101
00:08:14,69 --> 00:08:18,96
on the midterms folks are saying that
with my sagging poll numbers

102
00:08:18,96 --> 00:08:24,56
my fellow democrats don't really want me
campaigning with and I don't think

103
00:08:24,56 --> 00:08:25,21
that's true

104
00:08:25,21 --> 00:08:28,87
although I did notice the other day that

105
00:08:28,87 --> 00:08:35,87
sashimi the speaker a career day and she
invited bill clinton's I

106
00:08:36,41 --> 00:08:43,41
I was a are all heard

107
00:08:44,42 --> 00:08:47,06
what we're doing whatever it takes to
win

108
00:08:47,06 --> 00:08:50,51
a ruthless game republicans

109
00:08:50,51 --> 00:08:53,8
the true story republicans actually

110
00:08:53,8 --> 00:08:57,65
brought in a group of consultants to
teach their candidates

111
00:08:57,65 --> 00:09:01,58
how to speak to women this trial

112
00:09:01,58 --> 00:09:05,82
are and I don't know if it'll work with
women but I understand that

113
00:09:05,82 --> 00:09:12,82
america's teenage boys are signing up to
one for the senate and rolls

114
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:17,73
anyway why you guess what was on a

115
00:09:17,73 --> 00:09:21,31
horse-race I'm gonna do what I do I'm
gonna be focused

116
00:09:21,31 --> 00:09:26,67
on everyday Americans just yesterday I
read a heart-breaking letter

117
00:09:26,67 --> 00:09:30,94
you know I get letters from folks around
the country every day I get 10 that I

118
00:09:30,94 --> 00:09:31,37
read

119
00:09:31,37 --> 00:09:35,48
this this one got to maim a Virginia man
has been stuck in the same part time job

120
00:09:35,48 --> 00:09:36,18
for years

121
00:09:36,18 --> 00:09:39,5
no respect from his boss no chance to
get ahead

122
00:09:39,5 --> 00:09:42,76
I really wish or can we stop writing

123
00:09:42,76 --> 00:09:49,76
in

124
00:09:51,18 --> 00:09:56,73
we gonna pick up owner

125
00:09:56,73 --> 00:09:57,52
and I'm feeling

126
00:09:57,52 --> 00:10:00,85
sorry believe it or not for the speaker
has as well

127
00:10:00,85 --> 00:10:05,27
these days the house republicans
actually give john bainer a harder time

128
00:10:05,27 --> 00:10:06,24
than they give me

129
00:10:06,24 --> 00:10:10,19
which means orange really is the new
black

130
00:10:10,19 --> 00:10:17,19
I in

131
00:10:31,209 --> 00:10:36,239
but I have not given up they are working
with congress in fact two weeks ago

132
00:10:36,239 --> 00:10:40,619
senator Ted Cruz and I we got a bill
done together

133
00:10:40,619 --> 00:10:44,85
and I have to say the signing ceremony
was something special picture but either

134
00:10:44,85 --> 00:10:51,85
I

135
00:10:58,38 --> 00:10:59,41
I'm not gonna

136
00:10:59,41 --> 00:11:02,84
what Washington seems more dysfunctional
than ever

137
00:11:02,84 --> 00:11:06,07
gridlock has gotten so bad in this town

138
00:11:06,07 --> 00:11:13,07
your you have to wonder what we do to
piss off chris Christie so bad I

139
00:11:21,24 --> 00:11:25,36
one issue for example where minimal
agree on is unemployment insurance

140
00:11:25,36 --> 00:11:28,74
republicans continue to refuse to extend

141
00:11:28,74 --> 00:11:33,339
a you know what I am beginning to think
they've got a point if you want to get

142
00:11:33,339 --> 00:11:34,
paid

143
00:11:34, --> 00:11:41,
while not working usual a 2-1 for
congress just like everybody else

144
00:11:45,7 --> 00:11:48,38
of course there is one thing the key
problems mister

145
00:11:48,38 --> 00:11:51,64
they have tried more than 50 times to
repeal Obamacare

146
00:11:51,64 --> 00:11:56,77
despite that eight million people sign
up for health care in the first open

147
00:11:56,77 --> 00:12:02,17
enrollment

148
00:12:02,17 --> 00:12:05,519
much does believe one as how well the
Obamacare

149
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:10,72
have to work before you don't wanna
repealing whatever but his cholesterol

150
00:12:10,72 --> 00:12:14,05
drops want

151
00:12:14,05 --> 00:12:17,3
wanna your yearly checkup came

152
00:12:17,3 --> 00:12:20,26
what tickets to a Clippers game

153
00:12:20,26 --> 00:12:23,79
but not the old answer link occurs the
new Oprah Clippers

154
00:12:23,79 --> 00:12:29,73
I for them love for the day

155
00:12:29,73 --> 00:12:35,459
much more co-op all I

156
00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:42,459
one is it gonna take

157
00:12:43,74 --> 00:12:45,12
any word

158
00:12:45,12 --> 00:12:48,259
this year are promised to use more
executive actions

159
00:12:48,259 --> 00:12:53,029
to get things done without congress by
critics call this the Emperor

160
00:12:53,029 --> 00:12:57,62
period presidents true there's I don't
show up every day my office and do my

161
00:12:57,62 --> 00:12:58,04
job

162
00:12:58,04 --> 00:13:05,04
a picture of this I think

163
00:13:11,61 --> 00:13:14,649
you would but better person

164
00:13:14,649 --> 00:13:18,649
a more assertive approach considering
the the new conservative darling

165
00:13:18,649 --> 00:13:22,97
is none other than Blatter perm last
year

166
00:13:22,97 --> 00:13:27,39
pat buchanan said whose headed straight
for the Nobel Peace Prize

167
00:13:27,39 --> 00:13:30,56
the service at nine oh that sounds crazy
I'll

168
00:13:30,56 --> 00:13:33,6
but to be fair they give those to just
about anybody these days

169
00:13:33,6 --> 00:13:39,15
I so it could happen

170
00:13:39,15 --> 00:13:42,27
but not just path Rudy Giuliani said

171
00:13:42,27 --> 00:13:46,95
porn is what you call a leader Mike
Huckabee and shot him to keep talking

172
00:13:46,95 --> 00:13:48,46
about his bare chest

173
00:13:48,46 --> 00:13:55,46
we just got word I

174
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:09,919
look it up but talk about it a lot

175
00:14:10,49 --> 00:14:14,55
it is strange to think that I just
two-and-a-half years left in this office

176
00:14:14,55 --> 00:14:19,91
I'm everywhere I look for reminders that
I only hope this job temporary work

177
00:14:19,91 --> 00:14:26,91
or but its long time between now and
2016 and anything can happen

178
00:14:29,93 --> 00:14:33,639
you may have heard the other day hillary
had to dodge applying shoe

179
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:40,639
at a press conference I

180
00:14:47,68 --> 00:14:54,68
I love her picture could regardless of
what happened that on my last campaign

181
00:14:55,96 --> 00:14:59,93
and I'm beginning to think about my
legacy something all

182
00:14:59,93 --> 00:15:03,24
a mirror on the menu recently announced
she's aiming high school after me in

183
00:15:03,24 --> 00:15:04,15
chicago which

184
00:15:04,15 --> 00:15:07,67
is extremely homework I was even more
clarity here

185
00:15:07,67 --> 00:15:10,69
Rick Perry was here tonight is doing the
same thing in taxes

186
00:15:10,69 --> 00:15:16,33
take a look I

187
00:15:16,33 --> 00:15:19,73
correct

188
00:15:19,73 --> 00:15:26,16
there's a lot to me

189
00:15:26,16 --> 00:15:27,7
that I intend to enjoy

190
00:15:27,7 --> 00:15:32,029
all the free time but I will hear George
W Bush

191
00:15:32,029 --> 00:15:36,13
took up painting after he left office
which inspired me to get my own artistic

192
00:15:36,13 --> 00:15:42,579
side I i'm sure we got a shot at this

193
00:15:42,579 --> 00:15:47,56
maybe not the job doesn't work without
the slight

194
00:15:47,56 --> 00:15:51,8
I

195
00:15:51,8 --> 00:15:53,35
oh well

196
00:15:53,35 --> 00:16:00,13
assume it was fun

197
00:16:00,13 --> 00:16:02,42
doesn't have a new joke

198
00:16:02,42 --> 00:16:05,69
that does ok on a more serious note

199
00:16:05,69 --> 00:16:10,72
tonight reminds us that we really are
likely to live in a country where

200
00:16:10,72 --> 00:16:11,68
reporters

201
00:16:11,68 --> 00:16:14,73
get to give your head a State a hard
time on a daily basis

202
00:16:14,73 --> 00:16:18,46
and then once a year give him or her

203
00:16:18,46 --> 00:16:21,62
the chance at least to try to return the
favor

204
00:16:21,62 --> 00:16:25,53
but we also know that not every
journalists

205
00:16:25,53 --> 00:16:30,68
or photographer or crew member is so
fortunate because even as we celebrate

206
00:16:30,68 --> 00:16:34,16
the Free Press tonight our thoughts are
with those in places

207
00:16:34,16 --> 00:16:37,72
around the globe like ukraine and
Afghanistan

208
00:16:37,72 --> 00:16:41,34
and Syria in Egypt a risk

209
00:16:41,34 --> 00:16:45,18
everywhere in some cases even give their
lives

210
00:16:45,18 --> 00:16:49,81
to report the news and what tonight also
reminds us

211
00:16:49,81 --> 00:16:54,12
is better the fight for full and fair
access goes beyond the chance to ask a

212
00:16:54,12 --> 00:16:54,6
question

213
00:16:54,6 --> 00:16:58,97
as steam engine decades ago an
african-american who wanted

214
00:16:58,97 --> 00:17:02,69
to cover his or her president might be
barred from journalism school

215
00:17:02,69 --> 00:17:06,24
burden by Jim Crow and once marching
band

216
00:17:06,24 --> 00:17:09,72
from press conferences but after years
about her

217
00:17:09,72 --> 00:17:13,18
bike editors and publishers began
meeting with FDR's

218
00:17:13,18 --> 00:17:16,98
press secretary Steve or many met with
the president himself

219
00:17:16,98 --> 00:17:20,1
to declare that a black reporter would
get a credential

220
00:17:20,1 --> 00:17:24,75
and even when very much help in made
history as the first african-american

221
00:17:24,75 --> 00:17:28,3
to attend a presidential news conference
he was always welcome

222
00:17:28,3 --> 00:17:31,62
by the other reporters we was welcomed
by the press

223
00:17:31,62 --> 00:17:34,99
who told him I'm glad to see mcalpine

224
00:17:34,99 --> 00:17:38,45
I'm very happy to have you here nuts are

225
00:17:38,45 --> 00:17:42,5
settlement might have one of one serious
one questioner took

226
00:17:42,5 --> 00:17:47,33
& Harry's battles continue but he made
history and we're so proud of

227
00:17:47,33 --> 00:17:50,54
Sherman and his family for being here
tonight

228
00:17:50,54 --> 00:17:53,45
and the White House Correspondents
Association for creating a scholarship

229
00:17:53,45 --> 00:18:00,45
and Harry's neck here

230
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:07,49
for over 100 years even as the White
House Correspondents Association has

231
00:18:07,49 --> 00:18:08,549
told

232
00:18:08,549 --> 00:18:12,059
story america's progress you would the
two

Internet reporters as well

and through it all you've helped make
sure that even as

237
00:18:25,059 --> 00:18:29,379
societies change are fundamental
commitment to

238
00:18:29,379 --> 00:18:32,83
the interaction between those who govern
and those who ask questions

239
00:18:32,83 --> 00:18:36,179
doesn't change and is Jay will attest
