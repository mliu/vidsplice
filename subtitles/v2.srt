20
00:01:18,83 --> 00:01:23,8

country famous for chocolate

21
00:01:23,8 --> 00:01:30,8
and beer

22
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:32,57
leaders and dignitaries

23
00:01:32,57 --> 00:01:37,32
a big European Union representatives of
our nato alliance

24
00:01:37,32 --> 00:01:42,82
distinguished guests we meet here

25
00:01:42,82 --> 00:01:47,399
at a moment's have tested for europe

26
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:52,159
in the United States and for the
International order

27
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:59,159
that we have worked for generations to
build throughout human history societies

28
00:01:59,679 --> 00:02:00,92
have grappled

29
00:02:00,92 --> 00:02:04,149
with fundamental questions of how to
organize themselves

30
00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:07,58
the proper relationship between

31
00:02:07,58 --> 00:02:12,44
the individual in the state the best
means to resolve all

32
00:02:12,44 --> 00:02:18,91
inevitable conflicts between states and
it was here in your

33
00:02:18,91 --> 00:02:21,989
through centuries a struggle

34
00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:25,65
dewar enlightenment repression

35
00:02:25,65 --> 00:02:30,14
and revolution that a particular

36
00:02:30,14 --> 00:02:36,06
said abide eels began to emerge the
belief that

37
00:02:36,06 --> 00:02:39,459
to conscience and free will each of us
has the right

38
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:45,79
to live as we choose the belief that
power is just

39
00:02:45,79 --> 00:02:51,17
derived from the consent up the
government and the laws and institutions

40
00:02:51,17 --> 00:02:52,85
should be established

41
00:02:52,85 --> 00:02:59,56
to protect better understand those ideas
eventually inspired a band of

42
00:02:59,56 --> 00:03:02,359
colonialists

43
00:03:02,359 --> 00:03:07,639
across an ocean and they wrote them into
the founding documents

44
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:12,98
but still got america today including
the simple truth that

45
00:03:12,98 --> 00:03:17,34
all men and women are created a

46
00:03:17,34 --> 00:03:21,409
but those ideals

47
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:25,78
have also been tested here in Europe men
around the world

48
00:03:25,78 --> 00:03:31,65
those ideals have often been threatened
by older

49
00:03:31,65 --> 00:03:37,51
more traditional your power as
alternative vision argues that

50
00:03:37,51 --> 00:03:41,989
ordinary men and women are two
small-minded to govern their own affairs

51
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:46,09
that order and progress can only come
when

52
00:03:46,09 --> 00:03:49,29
individual surrender their rights to an
all powerful sovereign

53
00:03:49,29 --> 00:03:53,239
often

54
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:58,12
this alternative vision route itself in
the notion the by virtual race

55
00:03:58,12 --> 00:04:02,919
or fake ethnicity some are inherently
superior to others

56
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:07,25
and that individual identity must be
defined by

57
00:04:07,25 --> 00:04:12,459
us versus them or that

58
00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:16,78
national greatness must flow not by what
people stand for but

59
00:04:16,78 --> 00:04:22,62
what they are against in so many ways

60
00:04:22,62 --> 00:04:26,88
the history of Europe in the 20th
century represented the ongoing clash

61
00:04:26,88 --> 00:04:32,93
these two sets Abidi its both within
nations and among nations

62
00:04:32,93 --> 00:04:37,259
the offensive industry and technology

63
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:41,31
outpace our ability to resolve our
differences peacefully

64
00:04:41,31 --> 00:04:45,409
and evening even among the most

65
00:04:45,409 --> 00:04:49,07
civilized societies on the surface we
saw

66
00:04:49,07 --> 00:04:56,07
descent in the barbers this morning at
Flanders field I was reminded the power

67
00:04:57,06 --> 00:05:01,11
war between peoples sent a generation to
their deaths

68
00:05:01,11 --> 00:05:04,84
in the trenches and gas

69
00:05:04,84 --> 00:05:09,81
the First World War in just two decades
later

70
00:05:09,81 --> 00:05:13,599
extreme nationalism plunged this cotton
into war

71
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:18,63
once again with populations and slave
and great cities reduced to rubble

72
00:05:18,63 --> 00:05:23,24
and tens of millions slaughtered
including those lost

73
00:05:23,24 --> 00:05:28,409
in the Holocaust it is in

74
00:05:28,409 --> 00:05:34,65
response to this tragic history that in
the aftermath of World War two

75
00:05:34,65 --> 00:05:39,8
America join with europe to reject the
darker forces in the past

76
00:05:39,8 --> 00:05:43,24
and build a new architecture apiece

77
00:05:43,24 --> 00:05:47,419
workers and engineers

78
00:05:47,419 --> 00:05:53,13
gave life to the Marshall Plan Sentinel
stood vigilant in the nato alliance that

79
00:05:53,13 --> 00:05:55,229
would become the strongest the world has
ever known

80
00:05:55,229 --> 00:06:01,21
and across the Atlantic we embraced a
shared vision a viewer

81
00:06:01,21 --> 00:06:07,339
a vision based on representative
democracy individual rights

82
00:06:07,339 --> 00:06:12,43
and a belief that nations can meet the
interests

83
00:06:12,43 --> 00:06:17,94
other citizens through trade and open
markets a social safety net

84
00:06:17,94 --> 00:06:22,69
respect for those a different faiths and
backgrounds

85
00:06:22,69 --> 00:06:28,33
for decades this vision stood

86
00:06:28,33 --> 00:06:32,889
in sharp contrast to life on the other
side of an iron curtain

87
00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:36,15
for decades

88
00:06:36,15 --> 00:06:41,52
a contest was wage and ultimately that
contest

89
00:06:41,52 --> 00:06:44,589
was one not by tanks or missiles

90
00:06:44,589 --> 00:06:49,599
but because our ideals stirred the
hearts of Hungarians who sparked a

91
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,159
revolution

92
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:54,339
polls in there shipyards who stood

93
00:06:54,339 --> 00:06:57,949
in solitaire checksum

94
00:06:57,949 --> 00:07:03,99
waged a velvet revolution. without
firing a shot and east berliners

95
00:07:03,99 --> 00:07:08,229
march past the guards and finally tore
down that wall

96
00:07:08,229 --> 00:07:12,71
today

97
00:07:12,71 --> 00:07:15,71
what would have seemed impossible in the
trenches

98
00:07:15,71 --> 00:07:21,61
flanders the rubble in Berlin dissidence

99
00:07:21,61 --> 00:07:25,099
prison cell that reality

100
00:07:25,099 --> 00:07:28,599
is taken for granted

101
00:07:28,599 --> 00:07:33,899
a germany unified the nations of Central
and Eastern Europe welcomed into the

102
00:07:33,899 --> 00:07:37,529
family democracies

103
00:07:37,529 --> 00:07:42,11
here in this country once the
battleground have your

104
00:07:42,11 --> 00:07:45,779
we meet in the heart other union that
brings together

105
00:07:45,779 --> 00:07:51,81
age old adversaries and peace and
cooperation

106
00:07:51,81 --> 00:07:55,959
the people love your hundreds of
millions of citizens

107
00:07:55,959 --> 00:08:01,89
east west north south are more secure
and more prosperous

108
00:08:01,89 --> 00:08:05,169
because we stuck together for the ideals

109
00:08:05,169 --> 00:08:09,36
we share

110
00:08:09,36 --> 00:08:13,99
and the story of human progress was by
no means limited to your

111
00:08:13,99 --> 00:08:17,399
indeed the the ideals that came to
define our alliance

112
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:22,88
also inspired movements across the
global

113
00:08:22,88 --> 00:08:26,649
among those very people ironically who
were too often been denied therefore

114
00:08:26,649 --> 00:08:31,01
rights by Western powers

115
00:08:31,01 --> 00:08:34,469
after the second world war people from
Africa India through of

116
00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:39,55
the ok colonialism to secure their
independence

117
00:08:39,55 --> 00:08:43,149
in the united states citizens to freedom
rights

118
00:08:43,149 --> 00:08:47,04
and/or beatings to put an end to
segregation and the secure

119
00:08:47,04 --> 00:08:50,69
their civil rights

120
00:08:50,69 --> 00:08:55,91
as the iron curtain fell here near the
iron fist apartheid was on clenched

121
00:08:55,91 --> 00:08:59,779
and nelson mandela emerged upright

122
00:08:59,779 --> 00:09:03,19
proud from prison

123
00:09:03,19 --> 00:09:07,13
to lead a multi-racial democracy

124
00:09:07,13 --> 00:09:11,23
Latin American nations rejected
dictatorship and build new democracies

125
00:09:11,23 --> 00:09:14,6
an Asian nation show the development and
democracy

126
00:09:14,6 --> 00:09:19,81
could go hand in hand

127
00:09:19,81 --> 00:09:23,84
the young people in the audience today
young people like your work were born in

128
00:09:23,84 --> 00:09:25,06
a place and a time

129
00:09:25,06 --> 00:09:28,77
where there is less conflict more
prosperity

130
00:09:28,77 --> 00:09:32,09
and more freedom than any time in human
history

131
00:09:32,09 --> 00:09:36,43
but that's not because

132
00:09:36,43 --> 00:09:41,43
man's darkest impulses have vanished

133
00:09:41,43 --> 00:09:44,91
even here in Europe we've seen ethnic
cleansing

134
00:09:44,91 --> 00:09:50,01
in the balkans that shocked the
conscience the difficulties

135
00:09:50,01 --> 00:09:55,91
integration and globalization recently
amplified by the worst economic crisis

136
00:09:55,91 --> 00:09:57,36
in our lifetimes

137
00:09:57,36 --> 00:10:02,9
strained the European project and stir
the rise above politics that

138
00:10:02,9 --> 00:10:07,04
too often targets immigrants or gays

139
00:10:07,04 --> 00:10:14,04
or those who some seem somehow different
what technologies opened up vast

140
00:10:14,15 --> 00:10:17,41
opportunities for trade in innovation
and cultural understanding

141
00:10:17,41 --> 00:10:21,35
it's also allow terrorists to kill on a
horrifying scale

142
00:10:21,35 --> 00:10:26,97
around the world sectarian warfare and
ethnic complex continue to claim

143
00:10:26,97 --> 00:10:30,32
thousands of lives and once again

144
00:10:30,32 --> 00:10:34,51
we are confronted with the belief among
some butt bigger nations can bully

145
00:10:34,51 --> 00:10:36,26
smaller ones to get their way

146
00:10:36,26 --> 00:10:39,54
that recycled maxim that

147
00:10:39,54 --> 00:10:45,63
might somehow makes right

148
00:10:45,63 --> 00:10:50,68
so I come here today tensest that we
must never take for granted

149
00:10:50,68 --> 00:10:55,68
the progress that has been one here in
Europe and advanced around the world

150
00:10:55,68 --> 00:11:01,04
because the contest ideas continues

151
00:11:01,04 --> 00:11:08,04
for your generation and that's what's at
stake

152
00:11:08,07 --> 00:11:13,08
in Ukraine today

153
00:11:13,08 --> 00:11:16,48
Russia's leadership is challenging truce
but only a few weeks ago seem

154
00:11:16,48 --> 00:11:17,22
self-evident

155
00:11:17,22 --> 00:11:23,04
that in the 21st century the borders and
Europe cannot be

156
00:11:23,04 --> 00:11:28,19
redrawn with force that international
law matters

157
00:11:28,19 --> 00:11:35,19
the people and nations can make their
own decisions about their future

158
00:11:38,32 --> 00:11:41,3
to be honest if we define arnie are

159
00:11:41,3 --> 00:11:46,61
our interests Marily if we apply to a
cold-hearted calculus

160
00:11:46,61 --> 00:11:53,2
we might decide to look the other way
our economy is not deeply integrated

161
00:11:53,2 --> 00:11:53,58
with

162
00:11:53,58 --> 00:11:59,13
ukraine's our people and our homeland
face no direct threat

163
00:11:59,13 --> 00:12:04,8
from invasion a prime your our own
borders are not threatened by Russia's

164
00:12:04,8 --> 00:12:05,63
annexation

165
00:12:05,63 --> 00:12:10,93
but that kind of casual indifference

166
00:12:10,93 --> 00:12:15,13
would ignore the lessons that are
written in the cemetery's

167
00:12:15,13 --> 00:12:20,31
on this comment it would allow

168
00:12:20,31 --> 00:12:24,97
the old way of doing things to regain a
foothold

169
00:12:24,97 --> 00:12:30,57
in this young century and that message
would be hard not just in Europe for

170
00:12:30,57 --> 00:12:34,6
but in Asian in the Americas in Africa

171
00:12:34,6 --> 00:12:41,6
and the Middle East and the consequences
that would arise from complacency are

172
00:12:42,45 --> 00:12:42,82
not

173
00:12:42,82 --> 00:12:45,91
abstractions the impact

174
00:12:45,91 --> 00:12:49,48
that they have on the lives real people

175
00:12:49,48 --> 00:12:54,31
men and women just like us after

176
00:12:54,31 --> 00:12:59,57
enter into our imaginations

177
00:12:59,57 --> 00:13:03,36
just look at the young people in Ukraine
were determined to take back for future

178
00:13:03,36 --> 00:13:04,579
from a government

179
00:13:04,579 --> 00:13:09,01
rotted by corruption the portrait serve

180
00:13:09,01 --> 00:13:13,91
the Fallen shot by snipers the visitors
who pay

181
00:13:13,91 --> 00:13:19,98
their respects the meda there was the
university student wraps

182
00:13:19,98 --> 00:13:24,139
in the ukrainian flag expressing our
hope that every country should live by

183
00:13:24,139 --> 00:13:24,88
the law

184
00:13:24,88 --> 00:13:29,81
a postgraduate students speaking

185
00:13:29,81 --> 00:13:32,94
a for fellow protesters saying

186
00:13:32,94 --> 00:13:39,94
I want these people we're here to have
dignity imagine

187
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:44,279
that you are the young woman who said
there are some things that

188
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:51,279
fear police sticks and tear gas cannot
destroy we've never met

189
00:13:52,67 --> 00:13:58,93
these people but we know them their
voices

190
00:13:58,93 --> 00:14:03,6
echo calls for human dignity that rang
out in European streets and squares for

191
00:14:03,6 --> 00:14:04,47
generations

192
00:14:04,47 --> 00:14:09,31
their voices echoed those around the
world

193
00:14:09,31 --> 00:14:16,31
who at this very moment fight for their
good these ukrainians rejected a

194
00:14:16,8 --> 00:14:18,24
government that was stealing

195
00:14:18,24 --> 00:14:22,68
from the people instead of serving them
and are reaching for the same ideals

196
00:14:22,68 --> 00:14:29,68
that allow us to be here today

197
00:14:30,55 --> 00:14:34,86
none of us can know for certain what the
coming days

198
00:14:34,86 --> 00:14:38,95
will bring in Ukraine but I am confident

199
00:14:38,95 --> 00:14:43,03
that eventually those voices

200
00:14:43,03 --> 00:14:48,64
those voices for human dignity and
opportunity and individual rights

201
00:14:48,64 --> 00:14:55,64
Andrew love law those voices ultimately
will try I believe that over the long

202
00:14:56,82 --> 00:14:57,7
haul

203
00:14:57,7 --> 00:15:01,45
as nations they're free

204
00:15:01,45 --> 00:15:08,45
Esprit people the future is hours

205
00:15:09,14 --> 00:15:13,15
I believe this not because

206
00:15:13,15 --> 00:15:17,88
I'm naive and I believe this not because
the strength of our arms or the size

207
00:15:17,88 --> 00:15:20,92
Arcana means I believe this because

208
00:15:20,92 --> 00:15:24,6
these ideals that we affirm

209
00:15:24,6 --> 00:15:30,67
are true his ideals are universal

210
00:15:30,67 --> 00:15:35,83
yes we believe in democracy

211
00:15:35,83 --> 00:15:38,96
with elections that are free and fair

212
00:15:38,96 --> 00:15:42,22
an independent judiciary is opposition
parties

213
00:15:42,22 --> 00:15:46,47
civil society and uncensored

214
00:15:46,47 --> 00:15:49,49
information to the individuals can make
their own choices

215
00:15:49,49 --> 00:15:52,78
yes

216
00:15:52,78 --> 00:15:57,64
we believe in open economies based on
free markets and innovation an

217
00:15:57,64 --> 00:15:59,68
individual initiative and
entrepreneurship

218
00:15:59,68 --> 00:16:02,99
and trade and investment that creates a
broader prosperity

219
00:16:02,99 --> 00:16:07,63
and yes we believe in human dignity

220
00:16:07,63 --> 00:16:11,51
that every person has created equal no
matter who you are or what you look like

221
00:16:11,51 --> 00:16:13,66
or who you love or where you come from

222
00:16:13,66 --> 00:16:18,13
that is what we believe that's what
makes us

223
00:16:18,13 --> 00:16:24,149
strong

224
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:28,31
and our enduring strength is also
reflected in our respect for an

225
00:16:28,31 --> 00:16:32,29
international system that protects the
rights of both nations and people

226
00:16:32,29 --> 00:16:36,56
a united nations

227
00:16:36,56 --> 00:16:42,69
and Universal Declaration of Human
Rights international law and the means

228
00:16:42,69 --> 00:16:43,7
to enforce

229
00:16:43,7 --> 00:16:50,51
those laws but we also know that those
rules

230
00:16:50,51 --> 00:16:55,98
are not self-executing they depend on
people and nations a good will

231
00:16:55,98 --> 00:16:56,87
continually

232
00:16:56,87 --> 00:17:00,62
a birmingham and that's why russia's
violation up

233
00:17:00,62 --> 00:17:05,179
international law its assault on
Ukraine's

234
00:17:05,179 --> 00:17:09,699
sovereignty and territorial integrity
must be met with condemnation

235
00:17:09,699 --> 00:17:14,72
not because we're trying to keep russia
down

236
00:17:14,72 --> 00:17:19,75
but because the principles meant so much
to europe and the world

237
00:17:19,75 --> 00:17:26,23
must be lifted up

238
00:17:26,23 --> 00:17:30,39
over the last several days the United
States Europe in our partners around the

239
00:17:30,39 --> 00:17:30,87
world

240
00:17:30,87 --> 00:17:34,35
have been united in defense of these
ideas

241
00:17:34,35 --> 00:17:40,91
and united in support of the Ukrainian
people together we've condemned

242
00:17:40,91 --> 00:17:44,299
Russia's invasion of Ukraine and
rejected the legitimacy

243
00:17:44,299 --> 00:17:49,19
the Crimean referendum together

244
00:17:49,19 --> 00:17:53,66
we have isolated russia politically
suspending it from the g8 nations

245
00:17:53,66 --> 00:18:00,61
and downgrading our bilateral ties
together we are imposing costs through

246
00:18:00,61 --> 00:18:01,41
sanctions

247
00:18:01,41 --> 00:18:06,78
that have left a mark on russia and
those accountable for its actions

248
00:18:06,78 --> 00:18:09,799
and if

249
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:14,24
the russian leadership stays on its
current course together

250
00:18:14,24 --> 00:18:17,44
we will ensure that this isolation
deepens

251
00:18:17,44 --> 00:18:22,59
sanctions will expand and the toll on
russia's economy

252
00:18:22,59 --> 00:18:27,059
as well as its standing in the world
will only increase

253
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:32,26
meanwhile the United States and our
allies

254
00:18:32,26 --> 00:18:35,77
will continue to support the government
of Ukraine as they chart

255
00:18:35,77 --> 00:18:41,28
a democratic course together we are
gonna provide a significant package of

256
00:18:41,28 --> 00:18:43,669
assistance that can help stabilize the
ukrainian economy

257
00:18:43,669 --> 00:18:46,679
meet the basic needs the people

258
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:51,059
make no mistake

259
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:56,6
neither the United States nor Europe has
any interest in controlling ukraine

260
00:18:56,6 --> 00:19:01,23
we have sent no troops there what we
want

261
00:19:01,23 --> 00:19:05,929
is for the Ukrainian people to make
their own decisions just like

262
00:19:05,929 --> 00:19:12,929
other pre people around the world
understand as well this is not another

263
00:19:13,39 --> 00:19:15,03
cold war that we're entering into

264
00:19:15,03 --> 00:19:18,96
after all unlike the Soviet Union Russia

265
00:19:18,96 --> 00:19:22,23
leads no bloc nations no global

266
00:19:22,23 --> 00:19:27,75
ideology the United States

267
00:19:27,75 --> 00:19:34,64
and nato do not seek any conflict with
Russia in fact for more than 60 years we

268
00:19:34,64 --> 00:19:35,95
have come together in nato

269
00:19:35,95 --> 00:19:39,3
not to claim other lands but to keep
nations free

270
00:19:39,3 --> 00:19:43,98
what we will do

271
00:19:43,98 --> 00:19:49,94
always is up all our solemn obligation
our article 5 duty

272
00:19:49,94 --> 00:19:53,58
to defend the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of our allies

273
00:19:53,58 --> 00:19:56,669
and then that promise we will never
waver

274
00:19:56,669 --> 00:19:59,8
they donations

275
00:19:59,8 --> 00:20:05,06
never stand alone

276
00:20:05,06 --> 00:20:08,18
today nato planes patrol the skies over
the baltics

277
00:20:08,18 --> 00:20:13,01
and we reinforced our presence and Paul
and we're prepared to do more

278
00:20:13,01 --> 00:20:16,45
going forward every

279
00:20:16,45 --> 00:20:20,67
NATO member state must step up and carry
it sure the Burke

280
00:20:20,67 --> 00:20:24,59
by showing the political will to invest
in our collective defense

281
00:20:24,59 --> 00:20:28,4
and by developing the capabilities to
serve as a source

282
00:20:28,4 --> 00:20:35,12
international peace and security

283
00:20:35,12 --> 00:20:40,12
a course Ukraine is not a member of nato
in part because it's close and complex

284
00:20:40,12 --> 00:20:45,33
history with Russia nor will russia be
dislodged

285
00:20:45,33 --> 00:20:48,99
from Crimea or deterred from further
escalation

286
00:20:48,99 --> 00:20:53,89
by military force but what time

287
00:20:53,89 --> 00:20:57,08
so long as we remain united

288
00:20:57,08 --> 00:21:01,83
the russian people will recognize that
they cannot achieve

289
00:21:01,83 --> 00:21:05,929
security prosperity and the status that
they see

290
00:21:05,929 --> 00:21:11,42
through brute force

291
00:21:11,42 --> 00:21:14,98
that's why throughout this crisis we
will combine our substantial pressure on

292
00:21:14,98 --> 00:21:15,41
Russia

293
00:21:15,41 --> 00:21:20,97
with an open door for diplomacy I
believe that

294
00:21:20,97 --> 00:21:25,9
for both Ukraine and Russia a stable
peace will come through de escalation

295
00:21:25,9 --> 00:21:29,34
direct dialogue between Russian

296
00:21:29,34 --> 00:21:34,2
and the government of Ukraine and the
international community monitors who can

297
00:21:34,2 --> 00:21:35,16
shorter

298
00:21:35,16 --> 00:21:39,79
but the rights of all Ukrainians are
protected a process of constitutional

299
00:21:39,79 --> 00:21:41,65
reform within ukraine

300
00:21:41,65 --> 00:21:48,65
and free and fair elections the spring
so far russia has

301
00:21:50,01 --> 00:21:53,5
resisted diplomatic overtures annexing

302
00:21:53,5 --> 00:21:57,9
crimea massing large forces along
ukraine's more

303
00:21:57,9 --> 00:22:02,66
russia's just five these actions as an
effort to

304
00:22:02,66 --> 00:22:06,57
prevent problems on its own borders and
to protect

305
00:22:06,57 --> 00:22:12,74
ethnic russians inside ukraine of course
there's no evidence

306
00:22:12,74 --> 00:22:16,79
never has been up

307
00:22:16,79 --> 00:22:20,63
systemic violence against ethnic
russians inside if ukraine

308
00:22:20,63 --> 00:22:25,36
moreover many countries around the world

309
00:22:25,36 --> 00:22:29,29
face similar questions about their
borders and ethnic minorities abroad

310
00:22:29,29 --> 00:22:32,7
about sovereignty and self-determination

311
00:22:32,7 --> 00:22:36,16
is a tensions that have led

312
00:22:36,16 --> 00:22:39,47
in other places to debate and democratic
referendums

313
00:22:39,47 --> 00:22:43,13
complex

314
00:22:43,13 --> 00:22:48,05
and uneasy coexistence these are
difficult issues and it is precisely

315
00:22:48,05 --> 00:22:48,9
because

316
00:22:48,9 --> 00:22:52,4
these questions are hard that they must
be addressed through constitutional

317
00:22:52,4 --> 00:22:53,45
means

318
00:22:53,45 --> 00:22:59,43
and international laws senate majorities
cannot simply suppress my north's

319
00:22:59,43 --> 00:23:06,43
and big countries cannot simply bully
the small

320
00:23:08,56 --> 00:23:12,12
in defending its actions russian leaders
a further claim

321
00:23:12,12 --> 00:23:16,58
Kosovo as a precedent an example

322
00:23:16,58 --> 00:23:19,75
they save the West interfering in the
affairs a smaller country

323
00:23:19,75 --> 00:23:24,51
just as they're doing now but made only
intervene

324
00:23:24,51 --> 00:23:28,29
after the people a possible were
systematically brutalized and killed

325
00:23:28,29 --> 00:23:33,45
four years and possible only let serbia

326
00:23:33,45 --> 00:23:37,54
after a referendum was organized not
outside the boundaries of international

327
00:23:37,54 --> 00:23:40,59
law but in careful cooperation with the
United Nations

328
00:23:40,59 --> 00:23:44,72
and with Kosovo's neighbors love that

329
00:23:44,72 --> 00:23:51,06
even came close to happening in Crimea

330
00:23:51,06 --> 00:23:55,06
more Russia as pointed to america's
decision to go into Iraq

331
00:23:55,06 --> 00:24:00,05
as an example of Western hypocrisy now
it is true

332
00:24:00,05 --> 00:24:05,23
that the Iraq war was a subject vigorous
to make I just around the world but

333
00:24:05,23 --> 00:24:10,52
in the United States as well I
participated Matt Baker

334
00:24:10,52 --> 00:24:14,69
and I posed or military intervention
there

335
00:24:14,69 --> 00:24:17,88
but even

336
00:24:17,88 --> 00:24:21,18
in a iraq America sought to work

337
00:24:21,18 --> 00:24:25,12
within the international system we did
not claim

338
00:24:25,12 --> 00:24:31,09
or annex iraq's territory we did not
grab its resources for our own game

339
00:24:31,09 --> 00:24:34,65
and said we ended our war

340
00:24:34,65 --> 00:24:38,91
and left a rock to its people and a
fully sovereign

341
00:24:38,91 --> 00:24:45,91
Iraqi state that can make decisions
about its on future

342
00:24:48,41 --> 00:24:51,71
of course neither the United States nor
Europe

343
00:24:51,71 --> 00:24:54,91
are perfect in adherence

344
00:24:54,91 --> 00:25:01,31
to our ideas nor do we claim to be the
sole arbiter

345
00:25:01,31 --> 00:25:05,94
what is right or wrong in the world we
are human after all

346
00:25:05,94 --> 00:25:11,04
and we face difficult decisions

347
00:25:11,04 --> 00:25:16,35
about how to exercise our power but part
of what makes

348
00:25:16,35 --> 00:25:22,9
us different is that we welcome
criticism just as we welcome

349
00:25:22,9 --> 00:25:26,34
the responsibilities that com with
global leadership

350
00:25:26,34 --> 00:25:33,14
we look to the east and the South MC
nations poised to play a growing role

351
00:25:33,14 --> 00:25:37,06
on the world stage and we consider that
a good thing it reflects the same

352
00:25:37,06 --> 00:25:41,7
diversity that makes us stronger as a
nation and the foursome integration and

353
00:25:41,7 --> 00:25:42,59
cooperation that

354
00:25:42,59 --> 00:25:48,49
Europe has advanced for decades and in
the world

355
00:25:48,49 --> 00:25:52,66
challenges that are increasingly global
all of us have an interest in nations

356
00:25:52,66 --> 00:25:57,00
stepping forward to play their part to
bear their share the burden

357
00:25:57,00 --> 00:26:00,77
and two uphold international norms

358
00:26:00,77 --> 00:26:07,43
so our approach stands in stark contrast

359
00:26:07,43 --> 00:26:13,02
to the arguments coming out in russia
these days it is absurd

360
00:26:13,02 --> 00:26:16,13
to suggest as a steady drumbeat of

361
00:26:16,13 --> 00:26:19,42
Russian voices do that America

362
00:26:19,42 --> 00:26:24,18
somehow conspiring with fascists inside
of Ukraine for failing to respect

363
00:26:24,18 --> 00:26:29,23
the russian people my grandfather served
in patton's armor

364
00:26:29,23 --> 00:26:33,82
just as many of your fathers and
grandfathers fought against fascism

365
00:26:33,82 --> 00:26:37,75
we americans remember well

366
00:26:37,75 --> 00:26:41,43
the unimaginable sacrifices made by the
russian people in world war two

367
00:26:41,43 --> 00:26:47,72
and we have honored those sacrifices
since the end of the cold war

368
00:26:47,72 --> 00:26:50,95
we have worked with Russia under
successive administrations

369
00:26:50,95 --> 00:26:54,00
to build ties a culture and commerce

370
00:26:54,00 --> 00:26:59,49
and international community but as a
favor to russian

371
00:26:59,49 --> 00:27:04,69
but because a was in our national
interests and together we've secured

372
00:27:04,69 --> 00:27:09,17
nuclear materials from terrorists we
welcome rush into the G-eight

373
00:27:09,17 --> 00:27:14,17
and the World Trade Organization from
the reduction of nuclear arms to the

374
00:27:14,17 --> 00:27:16,5
elimination of Syria's chemical weapons

375
00:27:16,5 --> 00:27:20,15
we believe the world has benefited when
Russia

376
00:27:20,15 --> 00:27:24,25
chooses to cooperate on the basis a
mutual interests and mutual respect

377
00:27:24,25 --> 00:27:30,65
so America and the world

378
00:27:30,65 --> 00:27:33,66
and Europe has an interest in a strong

379
00:27:33,66 --> 00:27:39,98
and responsible Russian not a week 1 we
want the russian people to live in

380
00:27:39,98 --> 00:27:40,63
security

381
00:27:40,63 --> 00:27:44,62
prosperity and dignity like everyone
else proud of their own history

382
00:27:44,62 --> 00:27:51,23
but that does not mean that russia can
run roughshod over its neighbors

383
00:27:51,23 --> 00:27:56,21
just because russia has a deep history

384
00:27:56,21 --> 00:27:59,47
with ukraine does not mean it should be
able to dictate

385
00:27:59,47 --> 00:28:06,39
Ukraine's future no amount of propaganda
can make right

386
00:28:06,39 --> 00:28:13,39
something that the world nose is wrong

387
00:28:15,19 --> 00:28:18,38
and then every society must chart

388
00:28:18,38 --> 00:28:22,09
its own course america's pair

389
00:28:22,09 --> 00:28:27,34
or Europe spare is not the only

390
00:28:27,34 --> 00:28:33,59
ways to reach freedom and justice but on
the fundamental principle that is at

391
00:28:33,59 --> 00:28:34,34
stake here

392
00:28:34,34 --> 00:28:39,82
the ability of nations and peoples to
make their own choices

393
00:28:39,82 --> 00:28:42,87
there can be no going back

394
00:28:42,87 --> 00:28:46,77
it's not america the

395
00:28:46,77 --> 00:28:51,53
filled the Maidan with protesters it was
ukrainians

396
00:28:51,53 --> 00:28:55,87
no foreign forces compelled

397
00:28:55,87 --> 00:29:00,01
the citizens a Tunis and Tripoli to rise
up

398
00:29:00,01 --> 00:29:03,26
they did so on their own

399
00:29:03,26 --> 00:29:08,22
from the Burmese parliamentarian

400
00:29:08,22 --> 00:29:11,71
pursuing reform to the young leaders
fighting corruption

401
00:29:11,71 --> 00:29:16,809
and intolerance in Africa we see
something irreducible

402
00:29:16,809 --> 00:29:22,87
that all OVA share as human beings a
truth that will persevere in the face of

403
00:29:22,87 --> 00:29:23,75
violence

404
00:29:23,75 --> 00:29:30,75
and repression and what ultimately
overcome

405
00:29:35,64 --> 00:29:39,73
for the young people here today I know
it may seem

406
00:29:39,73 --> 00:29:43,22
easy to see these offenses removed from
our lights

407
00:29:43,22 --> 00:29:47,74
remote from our daily routines

408
00:29:47,74 --> 00:29:54,74
distant from concerns closer to home I
recognize the both

409
00:29:54,89 --> 00:30:00,41
in the United States and in much of
Europe there's more than enough to worry

410
00:30:00,41 --> 00:30:00,88
about

411
00:30:00,88 --> 00:30:07,88
in the affairs of our own countries
there will always be voices who say that

412
00:30:08,39 --> 00:30:15,39
what happens in the wider world is not
are concerned nor our responsibility but

413
00:30:17,09 --> 00:30:24,09
we must never forget that we are here's
to a struggle for freedom our democracy

414
00:30:24,89 --> 00:30:27,94
our individual opportunity

415
00:30:27,94 --> 00:30:31,4
only exist because those who came before
us have the wisdom

416
00:30:31,4 --> 00:30:36,36
and the courage to recognize the ideals
will only indoor

417
00:30:36,36 --> 00:30:39,65
if we see ourselves interest in the
success other people's

418
00:30:39,65 --> 00:30:46,65
and other nations

419
00:30:46,809 --> 00:30:52,02
now is not the time for bluster the
situation in Ukraine

420
00:30:52,02 --> 00:30:57,03
my crises in many parts of the world
does not have easy answers

421
00:30:57,03 --> 00:31:02,07
nor a military solution but at this
moment

422
00:31:02,07 --> 00:31:06,45
we must meet the challenge to our ideas

423
00:31:06,45 --> 00:31:09,73
to our very international order

424
00:31:09,73 --> 00:31:15,85
with strength and conviction and

425
00:31:15,85 --> 00:31:19,02
it is you young people

426
00:31:19,02 --> 00:31:22,87
a your young people like your

427
00:31:22,87 --> 00:31:26,679
who will help decide which way

428
00:31:26,679 --> 00:31:32,809
the currents our history will flow

429
00:31:32,809 --> 00:31:36,36
do not think for a moment that your own
freedom

430
00:31:36,36 --> 00:31:42,07
your own prosperity that your own moral
imagination is bound

431
00:31:42,07 --> 00:31:45,259
by the limits love your community

432
00:31:45,259 --> 00:31:48,409
her ethnicity

433
00:31:48,409 --> 00:31:54,019
or even your country you're bigger than
their

434
00:31:54,019 --> 00:31:57,23
you can help

435
00:31:57,23 --> 00:32:03,039
us to choose a better history that's
what europe tells us

436
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:07,049
that's what the American experience is
all about

437
00:32:07,049 --> 00:32:12,149
I say this as the president of a country
that

438
00:32:12,149 --> 00:32:16,039
look to europe for the values that are
written into our founding documents

439
00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:19,35
and which spilled blood to ensure that
those values could

440
00:32:19,35 --> 00:32:25,299
indoor on the shores I also say

441
00:32:25,299 --> 00:32:29,889
this as the son of a Kenyan whose
grandfather was a cook for the British

442
00:32:29,889 --> 00:32:34,879
and as a person who once lived in
Indonesia as a

443
00:32:34,879 --> 00:32:41,6
emerge from colonialism the ideals that
unite us

444
00:32:41,6 --> 00:32:44,95
matter equally to the young people a
Boston

445
00:32:44,95 --> 00:32:48,419
or Brussels or Jakarta

446
00:32:48,419 --> 00:32:51,85
or Nairobi a cracka

447
00:32:51,85 --> 00:32:57,17
archaea

448
00:32:57,17 --> 00:33:00,1
in the end the success of our ideals
comes down to us

449
00:33:00,1 --> 00:33:03,13
including the example our own lives

450
00:33:03,13 --> 00:33:09,24
our own societies we know that they're
always be intolerance but instead of

451
00:33:09,24 --> 00:33:10,44
fearing the immigrant

452
00:33:10,44 --> 00:33:16,94
we can welcome we can insist on policies
that benefit the many not just a few

453
00:33:16,94 --> 00:33:20,72
that

454
00:33:20,72 --> 00:33:24,9
and agent globalization dizzying change
opens the door

455
00:33:24,9 --> 00:33:28,23
about portunity to the marginalized and
not just

456
00:33:28,23 --> 00:33:35,23
a privileged few instead of targeting
are gay and lesbian brothers

457
00:33:35,7 --> 00:33:40,85
and sisters we can use our laws to
protect the rights instead of defining

458
00:33:40,85 --> 00:33:44,8
ourselves in opposition to others we can
affirm the aspirations that we hold in

459
00:33:44,8 --> 00:33:45,31
common

460
00:33:45,31 --> 00:33:50,53
that's what will make America strong
that's what

461
00:33:50,53 --> 00:33:54,46
will make Europe strong that's what
makes us who we are

462
00:33:54,46 --> 00:34:00,49
and just as we meet our responsibilities
and

463
00:34:00,49 --> 00:34:03,9
individuals we must be prepared to meet
them as nations

464
00:34:03,9 --> 00:34:07,63
because we live in a world

465
00:34:07,63 --> 00:34:11,59
in which our ideals are going to be
challenged again

466
00:34:11,59 --> 00:34:15,13
and again by forces that would drag us
back

467
00:34:15,13 --> 00:34:18,23
in the conflict or corruption

468
00:34:18,23 --> 00:34:22,58
we can't count on

469
00:34:22,58 --> 00:34:28,02
others to rise to meet those tests the
policies

470
00:34:28,02 --> 00:34:31,5
your government the principles are your

471
00:34:31,5 --> 00:34:34,84
European Union will make

472
00:34:34,84 --> 00:34:39,37
a critical difference in whether or not
the international order that so many

473
00:34:39,37 --> 00:34:41,48
generations before you have strived

474
00:34:41,48 --> 00:34:44,96
to create continues to move forward

475
00:34:44,96 --> 00:34:50,51
or whether retreats that's the question

476
00:34:50,51 --> 00:34:55,58
we almost dance what kind of your

477
00:34:55,58 --> 00:34:58,8
what kind of America

478
00:34:58,8 --> 00:35:05,8
what kind of world we leave behind

479
00:35:06,01 --> 00:35:09,93
and I believe that if we hold firm to
our principles and are willing to back

480
00:35:09,93 --> 00:35:12,34
our beliefs with courage and resolve all

481
00:35:12,34 --> 00:35:16,21
then hope

482
00:35:16,21 --> 00:35:22,46
will ultimately overcome fear and
freedom will continue to try and over

483
00:35:22,46 --> 00:35:23,32
terror

484
00:35:23,32 --> 00:35:26,39
because that is what

485
00:35:26,39 --> 00:35:33,11
forever star's in the human heart

486
00:35:33,11 --> 00:35:33,66
thank you very much
